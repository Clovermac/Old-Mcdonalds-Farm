## Proposal 
My terminal app idea is for a local farm selling away items where they are can combine less attractive purchases with items that are a popular staple together within a bundle basket. So for example placing a turnip, potato, tomatoâ€¦etc the turnip may be what is on their least selling items but within the bundle appear more enticing to the customer.

The user chooses between a vegetable only, fruit only, mixed or surprise me basket.  Within each basket you have three price ranges to choose from and the listing of its contents. The exception being with the surprise me basket, these items are not listed and there  would  only  be two price options instead of three. The user can add extra items into the bundle but can not remove items from a pre-made basket. The customer then enters their details- name and phone number. In return they will receive an order no. and the following date for when it will be ready for pick up (excluding Mondays)
